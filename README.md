## Resources
* [jQuery Plugin](http://tobiasahlin.com/moving-letters/#9)
	* This plugin turns all the letters in my name (top of the page) into their own span, then animates each to move and fade out on a timer. It is linked to an outside jQuery library.
* [jQuery Plugin](http://ajarunthomas.com/jquery/animateClick/)
	* This plugin creates a cross-like, shooting animation when you click on the my picture.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
My custom jQuery listens for mouseover/out to color sections of my resume blue as you hover over them (using the "this" selector). You can see the color changes on hover (and tap on mobile), as well as when thet replace the green sections under 600px.

In addition, I designed this site to mimic my real resume (http://alanasaavedra.com/images/saavedraresume.pdf), taking advantage of the white space, unique layout, and pop of color.

This was a lot of fun to work on, glad we finally get to use plugins!
